* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.5.5

File: NAMESPACE
---------------

- Exporting new functions

Various .R files:
-----------------

- Use 'nzchar(x)' instead of 'nchar(x) > 0'

File: rwi.stats.running.R
-------------------------

- Added prewhitening option to rwi.stats.running() and by extension rwi.stats().
  There are two new arguments prewhiten and n that are passed to normalize1()
  as in the xdating functions e.g., corr.rwl.seg(). Help file changed.

Files: corr.rwl.seg.R, seg.plot.R, rwl.stats.R, spag.plot.R
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Support for input of length 1


File: corr.rwl.seg.R
--------------------

- Fixed 'ylim' in plot()
- Fixed "no guides" case
- stops with a clear error message if 'rwl' has too few rows for the given
  'seg.length' and 'bin.floor' combination

File: fill.internal.NA.R
------------------------

- New function fill.internal.NA() fills NA values internal to a series.
  Written by Andy Bunn and Mikko Korpela. Help page added as well.

File: pointer.R
---------------

- New function pointer() calculates pointer years from a group of
  ring-width series.  Written by Pierre Mérian, adapted for dplR and
  improved by Andy Bunn and Mikko Korpela. Help page added as well.

File: rcs.R
-----------

- Graceful handling of empty input

File: read.compact.R
--------------------

- Pretty printing of summary output, no more ragged lines

File: read.fh.R
---------------

- Pretty printing of summary output, no more ragged lines
- More robust detection of block and single column data representations
- Data block, when using block representation, is interpreted as fixed
  width fields (10*6)). Reference: TRiCYCLE Users Manual, Version 0.2.6.
- Different units are supported. Default is 1/100 mm.
- Each data block is mapped to the correct header block. Previously, there
  was a risk of using the wrong header if the file contained data in
  formats other than "Tree" or "Single". Also, the end position
  of any data block could be off if data with different formats was
  present in the file. Presumably the function would have failed with an
  obscure error message.
- Added support for site, tree, core, etc. metadata. Results are given as
  an attribute of the return value, named "ids".
- Added support for MissingRingsBefore (pith offset) metadata. Results are
  given as an attribute named "po".

File: read.tucson.R
-------------------

- Fixed trimming of all-NA rows
- Fixed a bug that could crash R if the fided-width columns of the input
  file did not follow the (loose) specifications of the Tucson format
- AB: Note to dplR developers that this is a result of a poor standard in
  the Tucson format but this fix is needed to work with files that are
  on the ITRDB. Interestingly, dpl and ARSTAN are more robust to these
  kinds of inconsistencies. Mikko's note: always check that your
  assumptions a piece of input are correct before using the said input
  to compute array indices, particularly in C code.
- Can deal with CR CR LF newlines by reading the whole file into memory
  at first and stripping empty lines
- Can read non-standard files where one or more of the stop markers is
  the 11th data column of its row
- Can read non-standard files where columns don't have their proper
  widths, including tab-delimited files
- Can read non-standard files where missing data is marked with
  non-numeric characters
- Printed summary is justified, no more ragged lines
- Interprets lines containing "#" characters (in positions 1-78) as
  comments. For now, comments are ignored.
- Fixed a bug that could cause mixing of values from two or more
  measurement series sharing the same ID. Now it is an error if the input
  file contains more than one measurement for any year, ID pair.
- Accommodate mid-series upper and lower case differences: If a series
  does not end with a stop marker, see if the series ID of the next row
  after the last belonging to the series without a stop marker matches
  when case differences are ignored. If so, interpret these as the same
  series.

File: write.tucson.R
--------------------

- Instead of always using 1000, 999 is now randomly converted to either
  998 or 1000 (prec == 0.01) => no bias (even if small)

* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.5.4

File: DESCRIPTION
-----------------

- Depends: R (>= 2.15.0) to accommodate use of .filled.contour() in
  wavelet.plot(). Also enables the use of paste0().

File: NAMESPACE
---------------

- Imports from package stringr (also in DESCRIPTION)
- Exports new function autoread.ids()

Various .R files
----------------

- use paste0(...) instead of paste(..., sep="")
- prettier, more consistent formatting of source code

File: helpers.R
---------------

- New internal function check.flags() requires that its arguments are TRUE
  or FALSE

File: read.ids.R
----------------

- Optional automatic detection of the site-tree-core scheme (stc="auto")
- Optional fixing of typos in series names
- Optional (adaptive) case insensitivity
- New wrapper function autoread.ids() calls read.ids with stc="auto" and
  an alternative set of parameter values

File: read.tucson.R
-------------------

- More robust detection of header

File: wavelet.plot.R
--------------------

- Switched from using an .Internal() call to using new bare-bones
  function .filled.contour() for the plotting. This is at the
  request of Prof. Ripley who wrote that 'Packages should not call
  .Internal(): it is not part of the API, for use only by R itself
  and subject to change without notice.' In 1.5.3, the use of
  .Internal() or .filled.contour() was an if-else decision based on
  the version of R, but now the latter function is always used,
  making R >= 2.15.0 required.
- enabled translation of default value of 'key.lab'
- checks 'wave.list$x' and 'wave.list$period'

Files: write.compact.R, write.tucson.R
--------------------------------------

- Useless uses of eval() removed

2012-03-05 Andy Bunn
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.5.3

File: CITATION
--------------

- Uses the new bibentry() style
- Has an automatic entry for the dplR manual (R >= 2.14.0 requirement)
- Entry for "Statistical and visual crossdating in R using the dplR
  library" was updated

File: DESCRIPTION
-----------------

- Encoding: UTF-8
- Depends: R (>= 2.14.0)
- Author and Maintainer fields dropped (made obsolete by Authors@R)

File: NAMESPACE
---------------

- import() or importFrom() from all the "base" Priority packages
  that are used in dplR. Previously, the use of functions from those
  packages seems to have relied on the assumption of them being
  attached.

  Quote from "Writing R Extensions":
  "Packages implicitly import the base namespace. Variables exported
  from other packages with namespaces need to be imported explicitly
  using the directives import and importFrom."

  Clearly, packages with Priority "base" (different from the package /
  namespace called "base") fall into the category of "other packages".

- importFrom() used in more cases

- exports rwi.stats.legacy()

File: powt.R
------------

- New function for power transformation after Cook and Peters

File: rcs.R
-----------

- Allows for standardization by subtraction

Files: read.crn.R, read.tucson.R
--------------------------------

- Fix handling of (effectively) empty lines (thanks to Heather
  Gamper for reporting)

File: rwi.stats.R
-----------------

- rwi.stats() was renamed to rwi.stats.legacy(), potentially useful for
  comparing the results of the old and new code

File: rwi.stats.running.R
-------------------------

- zero.is.missing now has default value TRUE
- rwi.stats() is now a wrapper to rwi.stats.running()
- allows 'ids' to have extra rows if all names of 'rwi' appear as its row
  names

File: strip.rwl.R
-----------------

- New function for EPS-based chronology stripping

File: wavelet.plot.R
--------------------

- Replaces .Internal(filledcontour) with .filled.contour in R >= 2.15.0

2012-01-19 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.5.2

- Requires R >= 2.12.0 (use of markup in some Rd \title{} sections).
- Documentation has been cleaned up / uses better markup.

File: ffcsaps.R
---------------

- Checks that 'x' and 'y' are coercible to _numeric_ vectors

File: read.ids.R
----------------

- Checks that 'stc' contains nothing but integral values and has length 3

Files: write.compact.R, write.tridas.R, write.tucson.R
------------------------------------------------------

- Accept unknown arguments ('...')

2011-12-19 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.5.1

File: corr.rwl.seg.R
--------------------

- New parameters 'master' and 'master.yrs': Instead of letting
  corr.rwl.seg() compute master series based on 'rwl', the user can use
  her own master series.
- Ensures that rwl (and master) have consecutive years in increasing order
- Uses full form "greater" instead of "g" in calls to cor.test()

File: corr.series.seg.R
-----------------------

- Uses full form "greater" instead of "g" in calls to cor.test()

2011-11-23 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.5.0

Various .R files:
-----------------

- Use TRUE instead of T
- sapply() replaced with vapply() or vectorized operations

File: detrend.series.R
----------------------

- Checks that there are no NAs in the middle of the series.  Series from
  dplR rwl data.frames don't have mid-series NAs (unless manipulated by
  the user), but other data might.

File: read.crn.R
----------------

- Calls to read.fwf() now set the colClasses parameter. This gives
  more predictable behavior when the input file contains non-integer
  data where integers are expected. That is,.the function stops with
  a clear error message, whereas previously, the resulting data.frame
  would have contained seemingly random zeros.
- Some optimizations (vectorization, less copying, etc.)
- In the non-standard situation of multiple series per file, the previous
  versions assumed the same range of years for all series. This rule,
  breaking of which would give strange results, no longer applies.

File: read.fh.R
---------------

- Replaced read.csv() with readLines()
- Unnecessary captures removed from regular expressions
- Small optimizations (e.g., positions() was replaced with a more
  efficient solutions)
- The possibly dangerous removal of zeros, even from the middle of
  series, was rewritten
- Gives a clear error message when a data series has unexpected length
- Handles empty files / files with zero records better

File: read.tucson.R
-------------------

- Calls to read.fwf() now set the colClasses parameter (see explanation
  above)

File: rwi.stats.running.R
-------------------------

- Fixes a bug where the function would not work if 'ids' was NULL

2011-11-14 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.9

File: rcompact.c
----------------

- read.compact() now accepts series IDs consisting of any sequence of
  printable ASCII characters.

2011-11-06 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.8

File: NAMESPACE
---------------

- Made some internal functions truly internal by removing them from the
  export list

File: dplR-internal.Rd
----------------------

- The file was removed

Various .c and .h files:
------------------------

- NULL, TRUE and FALSE are used for clarity
- Rboolean type is now used more extensively for truth values
- stddef.h is #included where NULL is used

Various .R files:
-----------------

- When indexing data.frames, use df[[foo]][bar] instead of df[bar, foo]
  when foo is a single index (or df$foo[bar] instead of df[bar, "foo"]).
  The former is supposed to be faster than the latter.
  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-October/062313.html
- Some input checks added

File: combine.rwl.R
-------------------

- Avoids some conversions between matrix and data.frame

File: ffcsaps.R
---------------

- For loop removed in ffppual (constant number of iterations)
- Useless instances of cbind() and rbind() removed
- Avoids computing or passing as arguments things that are already known
  or constant
- ffsorted2() is a modified version of ffsorted() which should speed
  things up a little by making a rev() call unnecessary
- Unnecessary call to pmax() removed
- Added some input checks
- order() is now used instead of sort(method="shell"), because the
  requirements for the latter being a stable sort are unclear
  (?sort in R 2.13.2), and stability of the sort is required
  in some parts of ffcsaps (may be desirable in others)

File: normalize1.R
------------------

- For consistency, the first part of the returned list is now a
  matrix regardless of the value of 'prewhiten'.  This also gives an
  amazing speed improvement in corr.rwl.seg: from 42 seconds to 1
  second in the ?corr.rwl.seg Example, modified with
  prewhiten=FALSE, make.plot=FALSE.  This corrects the performance
  degradation introduced in dplR 1.2.7.  Tested on a computer with a
  Core 2 processor, 3.0 GHz.

File: rcompact.c
----------------

- Now accepts series IDs with spaces.

File: seg.plot.R
----------------

- Uses order() and numeric indexing instead of sort() and indexing with
  names

File: skel.plot.R
-----------------

- Replaced one for loop with vectorized operations

File: spag.plot.R
----------------

- Uses order() and numeric indexing instead of sort() and indexing with
  names

2011-09-14 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.7

Various .R files:
-----------------

- For data.frames, row.names() is now used instead of rownames().
  The opposite change was applied in one location (not a data.frame).
  Also, names() is used instead of colnames() where appropriate.
  This is because names() and row.names() are preferred to
  colnames() and rownames(), respectively, when dealing with data.frames.

File: read.ids.R
----------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in dplR 1.4.1 where the function would	not work
  for non-numeric identifiers or when identifiers did not fall in the
  range from 1 to n.

- Now respects input identifiers where possible: If all substrings
  denoting tree or core are integers, they are used. Otherwise,
  sorted unique identifiers (number of which is n.unique) are mapped
  to numbers 1:n.unique.

- Now allows the sum of the site-tree-core mask to be smaller than 8.
  The remaining characters will be ignored. This can be handy if there are
  additional levels in the ID hierarchy. Then, the series with matching
  ID strings up to the sum of the site-tree-core mask will be given
  matching tree and core numbers.

File: rwi.stats.running.R
-------------------------

- Now averages data from series with the same tree/core ID combination
  before computing any statistics.

- Now has the option to treat zeros as missing data (parameter
  zero.is.missing).  Defaults to FALSE which gives identical results
  compared to previous versions of the function, but should probably be
  set to TRUE for most purposes.

2011-09-01 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.6

File: corr.rwl.seg.R
--------------------

- Fixed a bug in the $flags part of the list returned by the
  function. Previously, a single flagged segment / series was not
  reported.

File: corr.series.seg.R
-----------------------

- Fixed a bug where moving correlations were computed using a window one
  year longer than seg.length. This problem had gone unnoticed when
  fixing some related bugs for version 1.4.5.
- Changed the x and y limits of the plot. Now the computation of the y
  limits does not use p-values as an input (the y-axis is correlation, not
  p-value). x limits are now set explicitly, and generally speaking there
  is more space around the plotted data.

2011-08-11 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.5

Various .R files:
-----------------

- Updates to sequence generation, e.g. use seq_along and seq_len where
  applicable

Files: ccf.series.rwl.R, corr.rwl.seg.R, corr.series.seg.R, series.rwl.plot.R
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A bunch of related bugs were fixed, some not present or already
(partially) fixed in some files:
- Fixed a bug where segment length was always actually one year longer
  than the specified seg.length (not in corr.rwl.seg.R, corr.series.seg.R).
- Fixed a bug where the requirement of fitting at least two segments
  did not take into account overlapping segments (seg.lag), therefore
  requiring more than the minimum number of years (not in corr.rwl.seg.R).
  Note: qa.xdate() still requires nrow(rwl) >= seg.length*2.
- Added a "plus 1" option (floor.plus1) to location of first segment.
  Works together with parameter bin.floor. Default value is FALSE.

- In corr.rwl.seg.R, cleaned up the code and fixed some bugs related to
  segment boundaries.
- In corr.rwl.seg.R, fixed a bug where multiple disconnected red segments
  were not drawn correctly.
- In corr.rwl.seg.R, removed unused variables / operations
- In corr.rwl.seg.R and corr.series.seg.R, arguably prettier x axis ticks
  and labels are used (now separated by seg.length).
- In corr.series.seg.R, an additional error check was added

File: tbrm.c
------------

- "Nothing to sum" case, when there are some numbers but all are too far
  from median, returns NaN instead of NA.  Finally, this is consistent
  with tbrm() coded in R, prior to dplR 1.2.7.

File: write.compact.R
---------------------

- Fixed two precedence issues that luckily didn't result in erroneous
  behaviour of the function

2011-07-03 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.4
* Changes in documentation will not be reported anymore

Various .R files:
-----------------

- Parameters not changed by assignment anymore (complaint by
  codetools). Applies to direct assignment; assign() etc go unnoticed by
  codetools.

File: ccf.series.rwl.R
----------------------

- Cosmetic changes (white spaces, assignment operator)
- Parameter 'cex' is given in the call to xyplot, like 'col.line'. Both go
  to 'panel' in '...'.
- Parameter 'col' removed from function 'panel'
- Some extra steps are taken because we want to ensure correct operation
  now when formal parameters are not changed by assignment
- (1 + 1 - pcrit) / 2 == 1 - pcrit / 2 (at least within floating point
  precision), so we use the latter which is a simpler form

File: chron.R
-------------

- Argument checking updated

File: corr.series.seg.R
-----------------------

- Some extra steps are taken like in ccf.series.rwl.R
- (1 + 1 - pcrit) / 2 == 1 - pcrit / 2

File: detrend.R
---------------

- Parameter 'f' now has an explicit default value

File: detrend.series.R
----------------------

- Unnecessary double checking of 'method' argument removed
- Parameters 'f' and 'y.name' now have explicit default values
- Graphical parameters are reset on.exit()

File: ffcsaps.R
---------------

- Uses complete parameter names in calls to sort

File: glk.R
-----------

- Large parts rewritten
- 'glk(ca533)' example in glk.Rd runs about 100 times faster
- Now explicitly requires that the non-NA overlap between series be
  contiguous, which should be true in dplR. This was not checked in
  previous versions.

File: hanning.R
---------------

- Slightly more efficient computation

File: i.detrend.R
-----------------

- Parameter 'f' now has an explicit default value

File: i.detrend.series.R
------------------------

- Parameter 'f' now has an explicit default value
- Fixed a bug where the values of the parameters 'f', 'nyrs' and
  'pos.slope' were not reflected in the returned result, only in the
  picture.
- Saved result is used instead of detrending twice (once with all methods,
  then with selected method)
- "Enter a number" is asked until a valid number is received. Normal
  interrupt sequences work.

File: morlet.R
--------------

- Removed 'param' and made 'k0=6' an explicit default in morlet.func()
- seq(from=1, to=n) - 1 == seq(from=0, to=n-1)
- log2(x) instead of log(x) / log(2)
- Cosmetic changes

File: series.rwl.plot.R
-----------------------

- Some extra steps are taken like in ccf.series.rwl.R
- Graphical parameters are reset on.exit()

File: wavelet.plot.R
--------------------

- log2(x) instead of log(x) / log(2)

File: write.tridas.R
--------------------

- Fixed a bug in the handling of parameter 'crn.units'

2011-07-01 Mikko Korpela
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.3
* Changes below by Mikko Korpela

Directory: po
-------------

- A new directory used for language translations
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Internationalization

Directory: inst/po
------------------

- Location for compiled translations

Directory: inst/po/fi and contents
---------------------

- Compiled Finnish translations

Various .R files:
-----------------

- Diagnostic and normal output messages were edited to facilitate
  translations. Messages consist of logical units (no small fragments, but
  sequences of sentences is possible), and gettext() and
  gettextf() are used. Also plot labels, titles and legends are ready for
  translation

File: po/R-dplR.pot
-------------------

- A translation template for messages in R code

File: po/dplR.pot
-------------------

- A translation template for messages in C code

File: po/R-fi.po
----------------

- Finnish translations of messages in R code

File: po/fi.po
--------------

- Finnish translations of messages in C code

File: src/dplR.h
----------------

- A new file that (initially) contains definitions used for looking up
  translations of messages appearing in C code

File: src/rcompact.c
--------------------

- Supports translation of messages via _(...), where ... is the string to
  translate

File: DESCRIPTION
-----------------

- Added a link to the R-Forge dplR development page

File: cms.R
-----------

- Better checking of pith offset names
- Big performance improvement, mostly due to using vector operations
  instead of a for loop
- Results slightly different (on the order of 1e-15) due to polyroot
  having been replaced with quadratic formula, order of arithmetic
  operations etc.
- Helper function now has 2 parameters: no need for cbind() in caller

File: corr.rwl.seg.R
--------------------

- Additional parameter in yr.range()
- First definition of segavg.cor was not used. Now removed.
- Some unnecessary name assignments and conversions to data.frame removed

File: detrend.series.R
----------------------

- Fixed a bug caused by incorrect syntax in named argument (was <- in
  1.4.1 and 1.4.2, correct form is =). ModNegExp detrending works
  again.

File: glk.R
-----------

- Uses the complete argument name MARGIN instead of MAR

File: helpers.R
---------------

- Additional parameter in yr.range(). Used by all callers.

File: rcs.R
-----------

- Uses warning() instead of cat() in one (unlikely?, impossible?) error
  situation
- Better checking of pith offset names
- yr.range() called in "the big for loop" instead of apply. The loop
  exists anyway, and there's no need to keep yr.range() of all
  series at the same time.
- rwca is no longer a data.frame, and doesn't have unnecessary colnames

File: read.tridas.R
-------------------

- Fixed a bug where a wrong number of derived series was reported in
  summary output
- A performance optimization for the case where ids.from.title is FALSE,
  ids.from.identifiers is TRUE (the defaults), and there are no identifiers

File: series.rwl.plot.R
-----------------------

- Uses complete argument names

File: wavelet.plot.R
--------------------

- Uses complete argument names
- gettext() is used in some default values

File: wavelet.plot.Rd
---------------------

- Uses complete argument names
- Default values match the changes in wavelet.plot.R

File: write.crn.R
-----------------

- Uses complete argument names

* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.2
* Ran through Mikko's changes. June 2, 2011. AGB
* Changes below by Mikko Korpela

All .rda data files (change reported June 7, after release in CRAN)
-------------------

- Data files were repackaged by R-Forge using a tight compression
  level. This is done every time R-Forge builds the dplR package, but the
  files are expected to stay identical if no changes are made to the
  compression system. The new data files supposedly require R 2.10.0, but
  this does not affect dplR which requires R >= 2.11.0 anyway.

File: ccf.series.rwl.R
----------------------

- as.vector() is more intuitive than c() with one argument
- Cosmetic improvement

File: ccf.series.rwl.Rd
-----------------------

- bin.floor must be non-negative, not necessarily positive

File: cms.R
-----------

- Removed redundant c()
- Some values are stored for reuse

File: corr.rwl.seg.R
--------------------

* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.1
* All changes by Mikko Korpela

File: DESCRIPTION
-----------------

- Minimum R version is now 2.11.0 (previously not specified). Reason
  behind the requirement: The encoding support added to read.tucson
  brought out a bug in read.fwf. The bug exists in 2.10.1 but is fixed
  in 2.11.0.
- Suggests foreach and iterators (used in some functions if installed)

Files: bai.in.R, bai.in.Rd, bai.out.R, bai.out.Rd
-------------------------------------------------

- Cosmetic improvement
- Also changed indentation of .R files to the recommended 4 spaces, as
  in the other .R, .c and .h files edited in this patch set.

File: ccf.series.rwl.R
----------------------

- || instead of |
- Optimized the order of expressions in a chain of the form
  x_1 || ... || x_n (order did not matter when | was used)
- Removed an unused variable.
- Cosmetic improvement

File: ccf.series.rwl.Rd
-----------------------

- Cosmetic improvement

File: chron.R
-------------

- Removed redundant c()
- Default value of prefix is now "xxx". Previously the default value
  was NULL, which was then converted to "xxx".
- Cosmetic improvement

File: chron.Rd
--------------

- Documents new (explicit) default value of prefix.
- Cosmetic improvement

File: cms.R
-----------

- Some added robustness against weird input
- Optimizations
- Cosmetic improvement

File: cms.Rd
------------

- Note about the requirement that the years be increasing and
  continuous

File: combine.rwl.R
-------------------

  versions)
- Author of the patch mentioned

File: corr.rwl.seg.R
--------------------

- Cosmetic improvement

File: crn.plot.R
----------------

- Cosmetic improvement

File: detrend.R
---------------

- Under some circumstances, the function now uses the foreach /
  %dopar% structure from the foreach package.  Conditions for this to
  happen: foreach must be installed, and at least one of the more
  time-consuming detrending methods must be used ("Mean" doesn't
  qualify).  For a speed gain, the user must register a parallel backend
  for foreach.
- Cosmetic improvement

File: detrend.Rd
----------------

- Added notes about foreach and the detrending methods used by default.

File: detrend.series.R
----------------------

File: exactmean.c
-----------------

- Removed some explicit type casts.
- Doesn't use (pointless) dynamic memory allocation anymore.

File: exactmean.R
-----------------

- Converts the return value of length() to an integer: "programmers
  should not rely on it" (i.e. the return value may not be an
  integer).

File: exactsum.c
----------------

- Makes use of dplr_double instead of long double.

File: exactsum.h
----------------

- Defines and explains the new type dplr_double (for now, same as long
  double).

File: ffcsaps.R
---------------

- Tweaked error messages (should -> must)
- Cosmetic improvement

File: gini.c
------------

- Uses floating point constants instead of integer constants where
  appropriate.
- Some pointless dynamic memory allocations were removed (replaced by
  statically allocated memory).

-----------------

- Converts the return value of length() to an integer.

File: glk.R
-----------

- Removed an unused variable.

  used (moved from read.tridas.R)
- Also moved some other functions here

File: i.detrend.R
-----------------

- Fixed a bug where arguments nyrs, f, and pos.slope were not being
  passed to i.detrend.series.
- Cosmetic improvement

File: i.detrend.series.R

  statically allocated memory).

File: rcs.R
-----------

- Cosmetic improvement

File: read.compact.Rd
---------------------

- New entries in "See Also"

File: read.crn.R
----------------

- Streamlined file handling code.
- Now has a parameter for the encoding used in the data file. This
  makes it possible to read files with any character encoding
  supported by R (may vary between R installations).
- Removed an unused variable.
- Improved "if" constructs (|| instead of |, evaluation only until first TRUE)
- Cosmetic improvement

File: read.crn.Rd
-----------------

- Documents the new encoding parameter.

File: read.fh.R
---------------

-----------------

- Author of the patch mentioned

File: read.rwl.R
----------------

- Automatic detection of file type now includes TRiDaS and Heidelberg
  formats.
- Now uses match.arg and a switch expression to select the right branch.

File: read.rwl.Rd
-----------------

- Shows the new default value of the format parameter (related to the
  use of match.arg).
- Lists TRiDaS and Heidelberg formats.
- Removed some "See" links from "Details", because there is a separate
  "See Also" section, and the "See" links did not serve a specific
  purpose.
- Describes the different return values when reading different types
  of data files.
- Literal quotes were replaced with \dQuote.

File: read.tridas.R
-------------------

- Spelling change "meter" -> "metre"
- Helper functions moved elsewhere to make the file shorter.
- Changed the environment where some functions are defined.
- All end tag handlers now call function end.element.  Makes the code
  shorter but increases running time.  Now xgettext does not complain
  about read.tridas being too long.  It might be good to pay attention
  to the recommendations concerning diagnostic messages at
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Diagnostic-messages

File: read.tridas.Rd
--------------------

- New entries in "See Also"
- Spelling change "meter" -> "metre"

File: read.tucson.R
-------------------

- Now has a parameter for the encoding used in the data file. This
  makes it possible to read files with any character encoding
  supported by R (may vary between R installations).
- New fix.internal.na copes with successive NAs and vectors with less
  than 2 elements
- Cosmetic improvement

File: read.tucson.Rd
--------------------

- New entries in "See Also"
- Documents the new encoding parameter.

File: readloop.c
----------------

- Uses floating point constants instead of integer constants where
  appropriate.

File: rwi.stats.R

- Cosmetic improvement

File: rwi.stats.Rd
------------------

- Shows the (technically) new default value of 'period'.

File: rwi.stats.running.R
-------------------------

- An additional check is applied to the input.
- If the foreach package is installed, the function now uses it and
  %dopar% for executing the loop that iterates over the various
  running windows. If a parallel backend for foreach has been
  registered, this should give a nice speedup.
- Removed some unnecessary calls to inc, where the conventional
  from:to is guaranteed to succeed (to > from).
- Fixed an off-by-one error in max.offset.
- Now uses match.arg for 'period'.

File: rwi.stats.running.Rd
--------------------------

- Note about using the foreach package.
- Shows the (technically) new default value of 'period'.

File: sea.R
-----------

- In warnings, we use multiple arguments instead of paste.
- select.y() was removed (rows of data.frames can be indexed with
  character strings).
- Number of nested for loops was reduced.
- Unnecessary computations were removed.
- Added a check that the input x is a data.frame.
- Check whether 'se' is NA.
- Streamlined code.

- Cosmetic improvement

File: skel.plot.Rd
------------------

- Cosmetic change

File: spag.plot.R
-----------------

- on.exit() is used for resetting graphical parameters
- Cosmetic improvement

File: tbrm.R
------------

- Converts the return value of length() to an integer.

File: tbrm.c
------------

- No longer uses long doubles in places where they are not really
  needed. May slightly affect some computation results.
- Removed some explicit type casts.
- Removed two temporary variables. Now the expressions used for
  computing them are used directly in the proper place.
- Uses floating point constants instead of integer constants where
  appropriate.
- Uses right shift instead of division by two where appropriate.
- A relatively pointless dynamic memory allocations was removed
  (replaced by statically allocated memory).

File: wavelet.plot.R
--------------------

- Removed and commented out unused variables
- Default value of 'f' is now explicitly 0.5.
- Some cosmetic / readability improvements

- Cosmetic improvements

File: wc.to.po.R
----------------

- The function was moved from read.tridas.R to a new file.

File: write.compact.R
---------------------

- || instead of |
- Uses on.exit() for closing the file
- Cosmetic improvements

File: write.compact.Rd
----------------------

- New entry in "See Also"

File: write.crn.R
-----------------

- Removed unused variables.
- Streamlined code
- Cosmetic improvement

File: write.crn.Rd
------------------

- Max Width of Site ID is 6, not 5
- Some typos fixed

File: write.rwl.R
-----------------

- Added the option to write in the TRiDaS format.
- Now uses match.arg and a switch expression to select the right
  branch ('format').

File: write.rwl.Rd
------------------

- Added notes related to the newly added support for the TRiDaS
  format.
- Removed some "See" links from "Details", because there is a separate
  "See Also" section, and the "See" links did not serve a specific
  purpose.

* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.4.0
* Incporporation of TRiDAS via Mikko Korpela, May 16, 2011

File: NAMESPACE
---------------

New imports (digest, xmlEventParse from XML)
and exports (read.tridas, write.tridas, uuid.gen, po.to.wc, wc.to.po,
tridas.vocabulary).

File: po.to.wc.Rd
-----------------

New documentation file.

File: read.tridas.R
-------------------

New file. Function for reading TRiDaS format files.

File: read.tridas.Rd
--------------------

New documentation file.

File: simpleXML.R
-----------------

Fast function for writing XML files. Used in write.tridas, not
exported to user.

File: tridas.vocabulary.R
-------------------------

New file. Function for browsing TRiDaS vocabulary.

File: tridas.vocabulary.Rd
--------------------------

New documentation file.

File: uuid.gen.R
----------------

The new function uuid.gen creates a generator of Universally Unique
IDentifiers (UUIDs). It uses the digest package, making it a new
dependency of dplR. The code in uuid.gen itself is very simple.

This is a very generally applicable function. It is used in
write.tridas, but may also be useful to R users in general.

The synchronicity package in CRAN provides similar functionality (and
more), but is not available for Windows. Also, the UUID generator
returned by uuid.gen seems to be faster than the uuid function in
synchronicity. More specifically, the latter uses much more system
time. The difference in user time is small (in favor of uuid of
synchronicity).

File: uuid.gen.Rd
-----------------

New documentation file.

File: wc.to.po.Rd
-----------------

New documentation file.

File: write.tridas.R
--------------------

New file. Function for writing TRiDaS format files.

File: write.tridas.Rd
---------------------

New documentation file.


2010-11-15 Andy  Bunn <andy.bunn@wwu.edu>
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.3.9
* Added an option to control the colors in plot.wavelet().
* Added an option to plot wavelets side by side instead of stacked (plus a few owther beutifications).
* Changes mostly in wavelet.plot.R and arg side.by.side and key.col added to the help.
* Added an axis on side three for the wavelet plot.

2010-10-27 Andy  Bunn <andy.bunn@wwu.edu>
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.3.8 all from Mikko Korpela
File: corr.rwl.seg.R
--------------------

* Changed the code that computes the first year of the first segment. Now it doesn't waste data in the case that the first year of the data is at a multiple of bin.floor. The same change was made to corr.series.seg.R in an earlier patch (dplR 1.3.3).
Previously: else min.bin = min.yr%/%bin.floor*bin.floor+bin.floor
Now: else min.bin = ceiling(min.yr/bin.floor)*bin.floor
* The size of the bins is now seg.length, not seg.length+1.
* Fixed some (potential) errors caused by R dropping dim() when subsetting an array. The fix was to add drop=FALSE.
* Small optimizations in the style of an earlier patch to corr.series.seg.R.
* Replaced & with && in some if conditions.
* Adjusted the indentation of the source code.
* Added a check requiring >= 2 series in rwl.

File: corr.rwl.seg.Rd
---------------------

* Updated the min.yr, bin.floor code excerpt included in the document.

File: corr.series.seg.R
-----------------------

* The size of the bins is now seg.length, not seg.length+1.
* Similarly, what was previously
  to = max(series.yrs)-seg.length-seg.length
is now
  to = max(series.yrs)-seg.length-seg.length+1

File: crn.plot.R
----------------

* Moved resetting of graphical parameters to on.exit. As a result, resetting also works in case of an unexpected error that terminates the function.
* Reworked the structure of the function so that lines of code that are common to different branches (sample depth or no sample depth) are not replicated. Also removed special treatment of the case of nCrn==1. These changes have no effect on the output (the plot).
* Other tweaks also, mostly cosmetic.

File: detrend.series.Rd
-----------------------

* Correction to documentation: If only one method is selected, the function returns a vector.

File: ffcsaps.R
---------------

* An ugly work-around (test and transpose) for unwanted dimension dropping was replaced by drop=FALSE. Why didn't I discover this solution earlier...

File: helpers.R
---------------

* Added a few new helper functions: fix.names is (or will be) used in a few functions, and some other functions are "helpers of the helper". Compared to the old fix.names (previously in write.tucson.R), the new one has the option of unlimited name length, and the option of limiting the set of allowed characters to the union of LETTERS, letters, and 0:9, where letters (LETTERS) are the lowercase (uppercase) letters of the English alphabet.
* The new is.int tests if numbers have integer value.

File: morlet.R
--------------

* Added drop=FALSE to a few matrix subset operation, just to be on the safe side (later it's assumed that wave is a matrix). I don't know if the danger of a dimension drop (conversion to vector) could have materialized with any (valid) inputs.

File: normalize.xdate.R
-----------------------

* drop=FALSE

File: qa_xdate.R
----------------

* There is now a check that catches negative seg.length.
* The helper function is.int previously found in this file is now in helpers.R (completely rewritten).

File: rcs.R
-----------

* Removed the internal is.int function. The main function now uses the new version of is.int, located in helpers.R, which works not only for single numbers, but for longer vectors and arrays also. This upgrade in functionality is necessitated by the way the function is used in rcs.R.
* Fixed a bug, where the function only checked that the first pith offset is integer. Now checks all pith offsets.

File: read.crn.R
----------------

* Like rcs.R, also this function now uses the is.int located in helpers.R.
* drop=FALSE was applied to many expressions.

File: read.tucson.R
-------------------

* drop=FALSE
* no more as.matrix in many expressions

File: rwi.stats.running.R
-------------------------

* rwi is transformed to matrix form at an early stage, which may result in faster operation.
* drop=FALSE
* no more as.matrix in many expressions

File: seg.plot.R
----------------

* Does not crash in the case of ncol(rwl) == 1.
* Resets graphical parameters on exit, even in error cases.

File: spag.plot.R
-----------------

* Fixed plotting of a one-series data.frame.
* Previously, the number of columns in rwl was computed with both dim(rwl)[2] and ncol(rwl). These are equivalent. Only one of them remains.
* Checks that at least one series was given, otherwise stops.
* Computes y axis limits more sensibly: due to overlap being allowed in the plot, the maximum value may occur in a series other than the one that is ordered to be drawn on the top of the spaghetti plot. Also, the previous upper limit setting computed the maximum over a set of one value (which is wrong) that was possibly NA (which would crash the function). A plausible explanation for the origin of this bug is the conversion from data.frame to matrix performed by the scale function. This was probably not taken into account when indexing rwl with rwl[nseries].

File: write.compact.R
---------------------

* Now produces files with DOS / Windows / etc. line terminators, CR+LF, on all platforms. If this has any effects on compatibility with old software (not sure about that), I expect the positives to outweigh the negatives. Also, files with Unix (LF) line terminators (previously created by dplR on Linux and other systems using LF) may show as one long line with primitive text editors in Windows.
* The function now enforces a maximum length for series names differently: does not stop and print an error, but truncates the name. Also, the function no longer stops when characters outside the ranges a-z, A-Z, 0-9 are found, but fix.names drops the offending characters. The previous regular expression used for testing series names may have accepted non-ASCII letters, but fix.names does not (with basic.charset == TRUE). The mapping from original names to names created by fix.names can be written to a file (two new parameters to the function).
* Replaced one as.data.frame with a solution based on drop=FALSE.

File: write.compact.Rd
----------------------

* Added descriptions of the new parameters of the function. The descriptions are the same as in write.tucson.Rd.
* Added information about allowed series ids and automatic renaming.
* Author info now correctly refers to write.tucson instead of write.rwl.

File: write.tucson.R
--------------------

* The function no longer stops when characters outside the ranges a-z, A-Z, 0-9 are found, but fix.names drops the offending characters.
* Any automatic changes to series ids result in a warning or several warnings. Also, if the option to write id changes to a file is used, all the changes are written to the file. Previously, the excess tail of ids could be silently cut off.
* Now produces files with DOS / Windows / etc. line terminators, CR+LF, on all platforms. See write.compact.R.
* Removed the unused variable hdr.
* Moved some helper functions to helpers.R.
* Replaced one as.data.frame with a drop=FALSE solution.

File: write.tucson.Rd
---------------------

* Adjusted the description of parameter mapping.fname: Now all changed series ids are printed, also the ones that were only truncated.
* Adjusted the part of the Details section that describes automatic editing of series ids.



2010-09-21 Andy  Bunn <andy.bunn@wwu.edu>
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.3.7
* Modified wavelet.plot() to produce a better looking plot and put the wavelet code into a new function called morlet().
* Deprecated cwt.filled.contour
* Added normalize1 to NAMESPACE
* Added arguiment label.cex to pass to axis to increase the size of the labels on the plot in corr.rwl.seg() and modified 
  the help file accordingly. This change was requested by a user and seems like a good idea.
* Corrected some spelling in help for corr.rwl.seg(), ccf.series.seg(), and corr.series.seg(). I'm sure there is more.
2010-07-17 Andy  Bunn <andy.bunn@wwu.edu>
* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.3.6
* Modified rcs() to stop() if any of the pith offsets are <1 or not integers. The help file indicated that this should
  be so but it's now explicit in the code.
* Fixed a bug in corr.rwl.seg() where floating series were not being drawn properly - the plot had them displaying all the way to the 
  max yr range b/c of an inexing problem. Also made some cosmetic changes to the guides in between segments for the graph. I do NOT
  like the way the plot on this function is done with the odd bin and even bin looping. Very clunky and confusing to look at. The
  correlation part is fine and the graph is nice but the logic of the plot is silly.
* Clarified language the help page for corr.rwl.seg().
* Fixed a bug in corr.series.seg() where short series coupled with long segment lengths caused the function to crash. I added to the fix Mikko made 
  in 1.3.3 by requiring that the minimum series length must be twice the segment length. Otherwise the function is useless. Error message now
  indicates this as does the help file. Made some graphical improvements with bin lines extending past the actual bins to better match the 
  moving correlation line.
* Clarified language the help page for corr.series.seg().
* Fixed a bug in ccf.series.rwl() where panels were out of order on series with long time spans. This involved reordering the
  ccf.df$bin factor to be the same order as bins[,1].
* Clarified language the help page for ccf.series.rwl().
* Improved series.rwl.plot() to give more diagnostic information in four plots.
* Improved the help page for series.rwl.plot() to beter explain what it now does.

* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.3.5
* Modified the help file for write.crn() so that the elev in the hdr will be written in a way that might
  be more robust in terms of the ITRDB standard. But, it's very clunky and silly to depend on an unrelaible
  standard. I also added some text to the help file for write.tucson() to indicate that the header should be thought
  of as experimental. Thank goodness Mikko is working on getting tridas implemented.
* Fixed a bug in rcs() where the rc was calculated wrong if none. The function implicitly assumed 
  that at least one of the pith offsets would be 1. When all the pith offsets were >1 the function would crash
   b/c of bad indexing.

* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.3.4
* fixed a bug in detrend() where args nyrs and f were not being passed to detrend.series().
* Corrected at typo in Zang's name. (So sorry Christian!)

* CHANGES IN dplR VERSION 1.3.3 made by Mikko Korpela
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: NAMESPACE
---------------
Added rwi.stats.running to exports.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: bai.in.R
--------------
Removed one for-loop by transforming it to vector operations.
Also some other optimizations (move some operations outside the
remaining for-loop, streamline the writing of the results).

NOTE: Why is (was) there a NaN check in calc.area? I removed it as
pointless. Also note that NaN is different from NA (in my opinion, NA
check would also be pointless).

As calc.area became quite simple after my edits, I moved the remaining
code to the main function.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: bai.in.Rd
---------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: bai.out.R
---------------
Similar optimizations as to bai.in.R. One particular optimization was
to replace max(cumsum(dat2)) with sum(dat2), which gives the same
result (but faster) when there are no negative values, as in ring
width series.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: bai.out.Rd
----------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: chron.R
-------------
Now uses rowMeans (rowSums), which is faster than computing the means
(sums) with apply.

Now uses ar.func defined in helpers.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: chron.Rd
--------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: cms.R
-----------
Changed the sequence notation i:i to just i.
Removed the pointless variable err3.
Removed the err1 and err2 arrays, using scalar variables instead (only
need one value at a time).
The computation of err2 is now more efficient, and err2 is of opposite
sign than before (taken into account when the value is utilized).
Compute err6 with vector operations instead of using a for loop.
Use fewer multiplications in the computation of err6 by using the
common factor, sqrt(med).
Removed pointless call to the function c in c.curve <- c(index[,2]).
Avoid searching for NA values multiple times, save the results of the
search in the variable no.na.
Edited the if/else structure in the end. Now it makes fewer tests than
before.
Removed yr.range and sortByIndex, now uses those defined in helpers.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: cms.Rd
------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: corr.series.seg.R
-----------------------

Now produces a more useful error message if the data set is so small
that no segments fit over the data. Example based on the example in
the .Rd file:

>        data(co021)
>        dat=co021
>        #create a missing ring by deleting a year of growth in a random series
>        flagged=dat$'641143'
>        flagged=c(NA,flagged[-325])
>        names(flagged)=rownames(dat)
>        dat$'641143'=NULL
> dat=dat[(nrow(dat)-48):nrow(dat),]                    # clip
> flagged=flagged[(length(flagged)-48):length(flagged)] # clip
> seg.24=corr.series.seg(rwl=dat,series=flagged,seg.length=24,biweight=FALSE)

produces this message in dplR 1.3.1 (.2 also, I think):

Error in seq.default(from = min.bin, to = max(series.yrs) - seg.length,  : 
  wrong sign in 'by' argument

but after a change to the code of the function:

Error in corr.series.seg(rwl = dat, series = flagged, seg.length = 24,  : 
  Cannot fit any segments (not enough years in the series)

I also made a mostly cosmetic change (got rid of bins1 and bins2), and
made the following functional change:

Previously:
else min.bin = min(series.yrs)%/%bin.floor*bin.floor+bin.floor

Now:
else min.bin = ceiling(min(series.yrs)/bin.floor)*bin.floor

The example below shows how the new code line produces a less wasteful
result (min.bin1 below) than the previous one (min.bin2),
which jumps to the next level "one year too early", and consequently
misses a segment that would have been possible to include.

> min.year<-1900:2000
> min.bin1 <- ceiling(min.year/25)*25
> min.bin1

File: corr.series.seg.Rd
------------------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: helpers.R (new)
---------------
A couple of helper functions to work around a design stupidity of R:
http://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2008/08/06/design-flaws-in-r-1-reversing-sequences/

Also moved ar.func here. The function was previously defined in three
different places, and always functionally the same. I also optimized
the function a tiny bit. So, if any changes to the function are made
in the future, they will show up in every "client" function without
having to edit three+ different files.

Moved yr.range here. It is a slightly optimized version of the
function used in cms, rcs, rwl.stats, seg.plot, and spag.plot. There's
still a local definition for yr.range in corr.rwl.seg, because the
function there is a bit different.

Moved sortByIndex here. It is a slightly optimized version of the
function used in cms and rcs.

Is this a good place for the helper functions? If you have a better
suggestion, feel free to move the functions or rename the file.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: ffcsaps.R
---------------
Fixed the helper function spdiags. The previous version crashed
ffcsaps in the marginal case where it was given a data set with just
three points. The bug was kind of related to the design stupidity just
mentioned above. Now the helper function is documented, and uses the
function "inc" defined in helpers.R. The use of the inc function
avoids the problematic case where the sequence
max(1,1-d.k):min(n,n-d.k), which denotes row numbers in the sparse
matrix, might include zero. The "inc" function ensures that we get an
increasing (or empty) sequence (does not include zeros when we start
above zero), as probably was originally intended.

I also made the code a bit clearer by renaming variables.

I wonder what the kludgy part at the end of ffcsaps actually does?
Whose code is that? Could it be rewritten in a non-kludgy way and/or
with some more comments? What purpose does the variable x2 serve, and
why does it contain a fixed-interval sequence with a seemingly
arbitrary length of 101?

The kludgy part sometimes prints a warning.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: glk.R
-----------
Small patch. Avoids a crash in the unlikely scenario that the function
is called with an x consisting of just one record. After the fix, the
function returns (expectedly, but not too usefully) NA. Also removed
the unused internal function strip.na(x).

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: glk.Rd
------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: normalize.xdate.R
-----------------------
Changes comparable to normalize1.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: normalize1.R
------------------
Now uses colMeans instead of apply in one statement, and colSums
instead of apply in another statement.

Uses ar.func defined in helpers.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: plot.series.rwl.R
-----------------------
Save temporary results for reuse.
One line / statement removed (the result was not used).

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: rcs.R
-----------
Use rowMeans.
Removed yr.range and sortByIndex, now uses those defined in helpers.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: rcs.Rd
------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: read.tucson.R
-------------------
Fixed a bug concerning the width of the decade field in the case
long=FALSE. The correct choice is 4, and 8+4 makes 12, which is
consistent with 7+5=12 in the case long=TRUE, and the Tucson format
description (column 13 is already ring width data). The bug would have
caused trouble in the presence of 6 digit ring widths.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: rwi.stats.R
-----------------
Fixed a typo (seies -> series), another typo (Correaltions ->
Correlations). Reorganized the code a bit.

Maybe this should be fixed to use number of trees instead of number of
cores in the EPS calculation. Also, I think it's dangerous to divide a
sum of correlations by the theoretical number of terms in the sum,
because sum of the terms may end up being NA. Then the average of
non-NA elements, computed by dividing with the theoretical number of
terms, will be too small.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: rwi.stats.Rd
------------------
Added my name to it. Changed the "see also" (unintentional?)
self-reference into a reference to rwi.stats.running. Should the
reference have been to rwl.stats?

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: rwi.stats.running.R
-------------------------
Compute stats in a running window. New function. Computes the EPS a
bit differently compared to rwi.stats (see comments to rwi.stats.R
above).

Quite slow. Optimizations or (partial?) rewrite in C would be
welcome. Maybe some day.

The terminology used in the function arguments and the documentation
may need to be made consistent with other parts of dplR. I'm not the
best expert on that topic.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: rwi.stats.running.Rd
--------------------------
Documentation for the new function. Based on a copy-paste from rwi.stats.Rd.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: rwl.stats.R
-----------------
Removed yr.range, now uses the version defined in helpers.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: seg.plot.R
----------------
Removed yr.range, now uses the version defined in helpers.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: skel.plot.R
-----------------
Save temporary results for reuse.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: skel.plot.Rd
------------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: spag.plot.R
-----------------
Save temporary results for reuse.
Removed yr.range, now uses the version defined in helpers.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: spag.plot.Rd
------------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: wavelet.plot.R
--------------------
Use multiplication instead of exponentiation in the computation of the
power spectrum. This reduces computation time.
Fixed the messy indentation of the source code.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: wavelet.plot.Rd
---------------------
Added my name to it.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: write.crn.R
-----------------
Fixed two bugs: one affected lines with only one year, the other
affected the last line in case it was already complete (10 years).

Example of the effect of the first bug (last line in file):
xxxstd1990 540 12NANA 540 129990  09990  09990  09990  09990  09990  09990  09990  09990  0

After fix:
xxxstd1990 540 129990  09990  09990  09990  09990  09990  09990  09990  09990  0

Example of the effect of the second bug (last line in file):
xxxstd1990 540 12 554 12 499 12 262 12 502 12 435 12 472 12 513 12 538 11 679 119990  09990  0

After fix:
xxxstd1990 540 12 554 12 499 12 262 12 502 12 435 12 472 12 513 12 538 11 679 11


The fixes involved changing

for(j in 2:n.yrs)
to
for(j in inc(2,n.yrs))

and

for(k in 1:yrs.left)
to
for(k in inc(1,yrs.left))

where inc(from,to) is a function in helpers.R.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: write.tucson.R
--------------------
Added a new function parameter. Setting long.names=TRUE allows series
IDs with 7 or 8 characters depending on whether there are long year
numbers in the data.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File: write.tucson.Rd
---------------------
Describe the new parameter.

(Also) files not named here
---------------------------
Added argument names to every call of the seq function. Quote from ?seq:
     The interpretation of the unnamed arguments of 'seq' and 'seq.int'
     is _not_ standard, and it is recommended always to name the
     arguments when programming.
I didn't take credit just for these small changes (no changes to .Rd
files).
